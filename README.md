# Company Data Analysis using Excel

## Overview

This project presents an **end-to-end Excel-based data analysis** workflow applied to a companyâ€™s customer dataset.
The goal of this project was to explore customer demographics, income distribution, and behavioral insights (such as bike purchasing decisions), and then transform raw data into **actionable business knowledge** using **Excel cleaning techniques** and **Pivot Tables**.

The analysis demonstrates how Excel, when used effectively, can provide deep insights into data without requiring advanced programming. It also serves as a practical example of applying data analytics to real-world business contexts like **customer segmentation, sales strategy, and market targeting**.


## Dataset Details

The dataset consists of anonymized company records with the following attributes:

* **Customer Demographics**: Age, Gender, Marital Status, Education, Income, and Region.
* **Lifestyle & Assets**: Number of Children, Cars, Home Ownership, and Commute Distance.
* **Occupation**: Clerical, Professional, Skilled Manual, etc.
* **Purchasing Behavior**: Bike purchase decision (Yes/No).
* **Derived Features**: Age Classification groups.


## Project Highlights

**Data Cleaning & Preparation**

* Removed duplicates and formatted categorical variables.
* Standardized age groups into **Age Classifications**.
* Ensured numeric columns (Income, Age) were correctly typed for analysis.

**Exploratory Analysis with Pivot Tables**

* **Average Income by Marital Status** â†’ Compared income levels across married and single customers.
* **Purchasing Behavior by Commute Distance** â†’ Identified patterns of bike purchases depending on travel distance.
* **Education vs. Income** â†’ Highlighted how education levels impact customer income and purchasing power.
* **Regional & Occupational Trends** â†’ Explored how different regions and job types influenced bike purchases.

**Segmentation Insights**

* Customers grouped by **Age Classification (e.g., Group 2, Group 3, Group 4)** to analyze generational trends.
* Detected which groups are more likely to purchase bikes, providing **marketing strategy direction**.

**Visualization**
